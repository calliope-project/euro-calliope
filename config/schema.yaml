                    1. remove outlier data hours, based on full dataset;
                    2. select only data for year of interest;
                    3. interpolate empty data when the data gap is small;
                    4. fill larger data gaps with data from nearby years;
                    5. if 29th of February is empty and couldn't previously be filled, use data from the 28th of February;
                    6. select most complete dataset for each country from list of data sources, based on a priority order.
                    This process will fail if the 'most complete dataset' for any country has any remaining gaps.
