# Welcome to Euro-Calliope's workflow documentation!

```

The Euro-Calliope snakemake workflow enables you to generate a model of the European electricity system to run in the Calliope energy system modelling framework.

The workflow routines automatically build models from source data. Alternatively to building models yourself using this workflow, you can use [pre-built models](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3949553) that run out-of-the-box. You can find a more detailed description of the first application in a [scientific article in Joule](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.07.018).
